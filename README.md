## Hi there, my name is Daniel Lebedinsky ðŸ‘‹

I have a diverse range of experiences in software development and applied mathematics. I graduated with a Masters degree in Software Engineering from Harvard in May 2025. My main academic interests include quantum information, data science, and mathematical modeling. 
For my Masters program's Capstone project, I worked with a team of students and a customer to create a web application that analyzes patents to identify innovative principles with LLMs. Our application used a tech stack of AWS EC2, Docker, Python/Django, MySQL, LLM APIs, Swagger REST APIs, React JS, Tailwind CSS, plus a CI/CD pipline with Github Actions. My team wrote a research paper on AI applications to Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ).

In the last semester of my Masters, due to my outstanding academic performance I was admitted to the Harvard GSAS Special Student Program, which allowed me to take a Quantum Information course that was not typically part of the Software Engineering degree program. It covered applications of quantum mechanics, quantum algorithm development, error correction, Hamiltonian simulation. My final research paper was on Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT).

I am proficient in a variety of Python data science libraries, such as tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, pandas, and Apache Beam. I have developed software that makes use of pre-trained generative AI models. Additionally, I am skilled in statistical analysis using software such as R, JMP, and Microsoft Excel.

Prior to beginning my Masters program, I had experience in software development at Roche Molecular Diagnostics, where I designed, tested, and debugged internal tools using C++ and C# in Visual Studio.

I have experience in biotechnology, from BostonGene, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, where I performed numerous molecular biological lab techniques. 

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2020, with a BA in Mathematics.

I am currently learning the Lean programming language/proof assistant for fun.
Outside of programming, I enjoy art, reading, tennis, and swimming || hiking || skiing (depending on season).
